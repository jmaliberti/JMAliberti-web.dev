            <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
              <p>I live by the beach in Southern California, with my husband and our dog, Falkor. I've always been the tech-person
              of my household and still spend time at my parents' calibrating their surround-sound speakers and smart TV.
              It has always been my dream to have a job that allowed me to use my creative and puzzle-solving metality to fulfill my career potential.
              Being in the tech field just never occured to me despite how much I used and relied on it. At least, not until my life had changed quite suddenly.</p>

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p class="reviews">I studied at UC Irvine and earned my B.A. in English with an Emphasis in Creative Writing. After college, my main focus was working to pay off my loans.
              I had jobs in sales, customer service and even managed a day care center for several years each. Then the pandemic happened. It was then that I turned to SkillCrush.
              Getting a job as a leasing administrator, I studied during my lunch breaks and weekends to become a Front-End Web Developer.
              Now, here I am ready to help you!</p>
